{"name":"Leap Typing","tagline":"Leap Typing Project","body":"### Authors and Contributors\r\n@Dylan27 @ydok4 Julian Joshua Kane\r\n\r\n\r\n###Introduction\r\nLeap typing is a typing tutor designed to teach the user to both touch type and learn how to correctly use the keyboard. In the early stages we thought it would be for typing speed and accuracy but there’s so many typing tutors that are for that and none really for memory. Our game teaches users from all age groups what fingers to use while typing, with the help of leap motion we were able to track the user's fingers in contrast to the keyboard and accurately distinguish their typing pattern. With our statistics screen after each match showing the user's strengths and weakness it, it allows them to practice in areas that they need the most practice.\r\n\r\n###Leap motion game play Keyboard\r\nIn keyboard mode the leap will be looking down on the keyboard. Once a key is pressed, a function will return what finger needs to be used to press that key and then it will compare where the finger is in comparison to the keyboard. This works with both letter and word mode. \r\n\r\n###Leap motion game play Tap\r\nIn tap mode the leap will be looking up and can be placed anywhere the user can hover their hands above the device. In tap mode the leap will track the user’s hands, when a character appears on the screen the user will need to “tap” the appropriate finger. Once a tap gesture has been recognised by the leap, the software will compare the finger that was “tapped” to the finger that needed to be “tapped”. If the incorrect finger was used nothing will happen.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
